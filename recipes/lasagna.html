            <li><b>Meat</b>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
            <li><b>Onion</b> and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Tomato</b> products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar</b>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li><b>Spices</b> and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><b>Lasagna</b> noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><b>Cheeses</b>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li><b>Egg</b>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
